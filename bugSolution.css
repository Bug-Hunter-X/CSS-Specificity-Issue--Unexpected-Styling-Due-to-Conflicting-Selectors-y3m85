The following CSS code resolves the specificity issue by ensuring the intended styling is applied correctly:

```css
ul li {
  color: blue;
}

/*This selector is removed because it overrides the previous selector and is not needed.
.container ul li {
  color: red;
}
*/
```

By removing the conflicting, more specific selector, the general selector correctly styles all list items in the intended manner.
