The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors. The intent is to style all list items within an unordered list, but due to the conflicting selector `.container ul li`, the more specific selector overrides the general selector, leading to unintended styling. 

```css
ul li {
  color: blue; /* This is supposed to style all list items */
}

.container ul li {
  color: red; /* This selector is more specific and overrides the previous one */
}
```
